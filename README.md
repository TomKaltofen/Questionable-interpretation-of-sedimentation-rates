# misconceptions-accumulation-rates
In geology, many people interprete accumulation rates in relation to time. Yet, nearly no geoscientist knows the so-called Sadler effect. However, the results of simple statistics show that this effect is found in the basin between the UK and Poland (Southern Permian Basin). The stratigraphic data was taken from H Doornenbal, A Stevenson (2010).

The plot sadler_powerlaw.png shows the  frequency distribution of accumulation rate. Accumulation rate is the measure of accumulation [m] per time [mya]. 

The plot sadler_with_power_law_assumption shows the relation of accumulation rate to time span [mya]. The general assumption of the power law is not true for all sub-basins.

Most important however are the plots in the folder sadler plots, which show show frequency distributions of accumulation rates for single basins. Feel free to comment if you can see any exhumation events?

This work is based on my master's thesis. Unfortunately, I don t have the rights to publish the whole project. I would be happy if you want to discuss any parts further. Contact me.

# Questionable interpretation of sedimentation rates

Nearly no geoscientist knows the so-called Sadler effect and thus many geological interpretations might be partly wrong. In this repository, the Sadler effect was tested with statistical tools in the sedimentary basins in the area between the UK and Poland (Southern Permian Basin). The stratigraphic data was taken from H Doornenbal, A Stevenson (2010) as a 1x1 km grid.

To start with, the plot "sadler_powerlaw.png" shows the frequency distribution of accumulation rate (m/mya) in log unit for the total area. The interpretation of this graph is that the Sadler effect is indeed existing, but not a strict power law.

To go more into detail, the plot "sadler_with_power_law_assumption" shows the accumulation rate (r on y-axis) to time span (x-axis). CEBS refers to the whole study area, while the other 14 areas ensemble 14 smaller basins. Two interpretations can easily be inferred from this graphic. i) The statistical Sadler effect is existing in every sedimentary basin. ii) The longer the time span is, the lower is the accumulation rate.

This provokes some thoughts. For example, the Lower Rotliegend might not have been a time of low sedimentation in the Southern Permian Basin, since the time span, which is usually looked at, is longer than 20 mya (depending on source and age definitions), indicating that the Sadler effect already is enough to result in low sedimentation rates. 

Furthermore, the plots in the folder "sadler plots" show the frequency distribution of accumulation rates of different age intervals of sedimentary basins. As you can see, different graphs reappear and yes, there might be a meaning behind this. If you would like to discuss this or any other part, please feel free to contact me.
